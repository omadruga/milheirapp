# Sweets

- Nuxt autoimport is realy nice.
- NuxtUI also really nice, missing some features like a Navbar, but best UI to use with Nuxt so far.

# Bummers

- Prisma does not support ENUM type with sqlite connector (due to sqlite not having this type). Either have to setup up PostgreSql for development or use a Table as a Enum, which both suck. Issue on Prisma: https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2219
